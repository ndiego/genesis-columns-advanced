# Genesis Columns Advanced

Adds shortcodes to easily create up to 42 different columned layouts. This plugin was originally designed to generate shortcodes for every column configuration available with the column classes provided by the [Genesis Framework](http://www.studiopress.com), hence the name. As of version 2.0, the plugin is completely standalone and does not require Genesis.

> **Warning**
> 
> Genesis Columns Advanced is no longer being actively maintained and there is no guarantee the plugin will continue to work with new versions of WordPress. Consider transitioning to the native WordPress Columns block.
